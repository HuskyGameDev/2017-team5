Isis: Well done, farmer. But the retrieval of the amulet is not enough; you must complete more tasks for us.
Isis: My husband Osiris, the god of nature, will instruct you on what to do next.
Osiris: Those darned monsters won't get off my lawn. They keep wreckin' my plants!
Osiris: Boy, I'm thinkin' if you destroyed the monsters' evil power source, they would go find someone else's lawn to trespass on!
Isis: Remember, even the lives of monsters are precious! Do not kill anything! Just destroy the power source.
Isis: No! You shall not! Even the lives of monsters are precious. Do not kill anything! Just destroy the power source.
Ra: I like racing.
Isis: Do this for us, and we shall be very pleased.
