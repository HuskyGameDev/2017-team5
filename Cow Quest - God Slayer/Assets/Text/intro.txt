Once upon a time, in a land far, far away (a.k.a. ancient Egypt), there lived a humble farmer.
The farmer did not have any human family left, and lived alone with his cow, who was his best and only friend.
The farmer did not believe in the gods, and only cared about his cow and growing turnips.
However, during these times, the gods often punished those who did not believe in them.
To teach the farmer a lesson, the gods decided to take away the only thing he cared about that wasn't turnips: his cow.
Because the gods are show-offs who enjoy burning things, they smote the cow with a large and fiery meteor.
As the farmer witnessed the meteor fall from the heavens and heard his best friend's final, bloodcurdling moo, he realized that it could have only been the work of the gods.
Enraged and anguished, the farmer grabbed his trusty pitchfork and set out to find the gods.
And thus, a great journey begins...
