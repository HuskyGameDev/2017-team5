Ra: Congratulations, farmer, you have taken the first step in proving yourself worthy of the gods' help.
Ra: Isis, goddess of life, healing, and protection, will provide you with your next task.
Isis: If you want your cow, go forth and retrieve the Amulet of Horus from the Pharaoh!
Isis: Ensure that you do NOT harm any of my pets along the way, however!
Isis: All lives are precious! And those of my pets are more valuable than yours!
Isis: No offense or anything.
