Anubis: Slick moves, dude!
Anubis: Ask Tefnut for your next task. She's one cool cat.
Tefnut: *Sigh* Who are you and why are you bothering me?
Tefnut: I am Tefnut, the goddess of rain. Do you like rain? 
Tefnut: I don't believe you. Who actually likes rain?
Tefnut: No? I didn't think so. Nobody does.
Tefnut: Anyway, I want you to kill some plants for me. They keep absorbing all my rain.
Tefnut: Please mow the grass by the river. Or the papyrus. Whatever it is.
Set: Oh, and while you're down there, please kill my brother for me. I would appreciate it, really.
Set: His name is Osiris. Make sure you don't lose him in all the papyrus.
Anubis: Help me kill Isis as well. Those who do not dance with the darkness do not deserve to go on living.
Tefnut: I guess I may as well ask you to kill Ra while you're at it. *Sigh* Those light gods are always getting in our way.
